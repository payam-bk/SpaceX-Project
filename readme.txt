SpaceX Project Overview

This project explores SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and aims to predict whether the first stage of the rocket will land successfully. SpaceX claims they can launch a Falcon 9 to space for a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million typically charged by other providers. The key factor in SpaceX's lower cost is the reusability of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, which can return and land successfully after launch.

In this project, we will explore and analyze SpaceXâ€™s dataset to build an optimal predictive model for determining whether the first stage of a particular launch will land successfully. This prediction is critical in understanding the cost efficiency of each launch.

Our approach includes:

1-Data exploration

2-Data cleaning

3-Data preprocessing and standardization

4-Data visualization

5-Machine learning to identify the best prediction model

6-Saving the selected model for future deployment
